      This web application performs a semi-analytical calculation of the time
      evolution of the energy density \(\epsilon(t)\), net baryon density
      \(n_B(t)\), net strangeness density \(n_S(t)\), and net charge density
      \(n_Q(t)\) at mid-pseudorapidity produced by the primary collisions of two
      identical nuclei in central \((b=0\ fm)\) relativistic collisions. The web
      application then extracts the temperature \(T\), the baryon chemical
      potential \(\mu_B\), the    strangeness potential \(\mu_S\), and the charge
      potential \(\mu_Q\) as functions of time for the created matter that is
      assumed to be a quark-gluon plasma in full equilibrium under the chosen
      statistics (quantum or Boltzmann).
  
      Five input parameters are needed for a calculation: the atomic number \(Z\)
      and the atomic mass number \(A\) for the projectile (and the target) nuclei,
      the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), the proper
      formation
      time of partons \(\tau_F\), and the number of timesteps to sample the time
      evolution. Only primary collisions between
      the projectile and target nuclei are considered in the calculations;
      therefore, the transverse expansion and secondary scatterings are neglected.
      The energy and net charge densities produced in such collisions are averaged
      over the entire transverse overlap area \(A_T=\pi R_A^2\) where
      \(R_A=1.12A^{1/3}\ fm\).
  
      Note: the collision energy should not be greater than 200 GeV, because our
      parameterization of the transverse mass rapidity density at mid-rapidity
      \(dm_T/dy(0)\) is based on data up to this maximum energy. A typical
      calculation takes about 2-3 minutes when choosing 10 timesteps to sample the
      time evolution, so the maximum number of timesteps is set to 100 in order
      to save time.
